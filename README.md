# Ovoko

Heya there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to [Ovoko](https://about.ovoko.com/) mobile developer technical challenge!

> We just wanted to say thank you for interviewing with us! The job hunting process can be a really stressful and anxious time, but we promise you, we don't bite!

This is way less of a test with right and wrong answers and more of us looking at:

- "How do you write code?"
- "How do you test?"
- "How do you think about accessibility?"

**What we are looking for is a React Native app based on the [tasks](./tasks) we've set out.**

There's a quite a few tasks in there - so please, feel no obligation to do all of them - keep going until you get bored or stuck and just let us know where you get up to.

You can put as much or as little into this as you'd like - so feel free to go a bit wild if you want.

When you're finished with the exercise, please email your Ovoko contact with a link to your Github repository, or just attach it as a .zip file.
Thanks!
